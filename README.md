# PySQL
Experimenting with Python, PyODBC ðŸ”Œ, and SQL Alchemy ðŸ§ª to execute queries on multiple SQL Servers

# Story
Do you refresh your QA environments often?  
Do you have to manually run SQL transactions on all those environments to regain admin privileges?  
Not too long ago I decided I did not want to keep doing this every time we refreshed our DBs!  

`SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.`
