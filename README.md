# PySQL
Experimenting with Python 🐍, PyODBC 🔌, and SQL Alchemy 🧪 to execute queries on multiple SQL Servers

# Story
Do you refresh your QA environments often?  
Do you have to manually run SQL transactions on all those environments to regain admin privileges?  
Not too long ago I decided I did not want to keep doing this every time we refreshed our DBs!  

`SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.`  
`SQLAlchemy includes dialects for SQLite, Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL, Firebird, Sybase and others, most of which support multiple DBAPIs.`
